<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mario</h1>
<h4>Hello, world. I'm Mario CÃ©spedes, I am a person who enjoys exploring various facets of life. I have a deep passion for reading and immerse myself in literature whenever I can. Music also holds a special place in my heart, as it serves as a source of inspiration and relaxation.
As a responsible and dedicated person, I strive for excellence in everything I do. I am a high performance volleyball athlete and constantly strive to achieve new goals. In addition to my sporting activities, I am very interested in the world of technology and programming. I am currently studying programming and immersing myself in all aspects of technology. Being a leader comes naturally to me, and I have valuable experience in leading and guiding people. I am self-critical and always looking for ways to improve myself and the activities I perform. Patience is one of my virtues, which allows me to face challenges calmly and serenely. I currently study English and Latin, exploring the nuances of language and ancient civilizations. My curiosity extends to poetry, philosophy and the intricacies of human thought. I am especially fascinated by the workings of the brain, consciousness, psychology, and human behavior, am deeply curious about how things work, and constantly seek to unravel the inner workings of various objects and systems. Although I am passionate about programming, there are times when I find it a bit tedious. In those cases, I look for other intellectual and creative outlets to maintain a balanced perspective.

I currently reside in IbaguÃ©, Tolima, Colombia, but I have a strong desire to travel and explore new cultures and places. I am intrigued by the mechanics of automobiles, motorcycles and the principles of physics and mathematics that govern their operation. In my spare time, I indulge in my hobbies, which include reading, training, running and meditation. I dream of having a workshop where I can modify motorcycles and cars in the style of icons like Smokey Nagata and Akira Nakai.
